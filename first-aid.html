          <h2>What is First Aid?</h2>
          <p>First aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress.</div>

      <div class="Common-First-Aid">
        <h2>Nosebleeding</h2>
        <p>A nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is an instance of bleeding from the nose. Blood can flow down into the stomach, and cause nausea and vomiting. In more severe cases, blood may come out of both nostrils. Rarely, bleeding may be so significant that low blood pressure occurs.</p>
        <h2>Food Poisoning</h2>
        <p> If an individual ingests a harmful substance, it is imperative to connect with Poison Control promptly.</p>
          <h2>Anaphylaxis/Allergy</h2>
          <p> Anaphylaxis is a serious, potentially fatal allergic reaction and medical emergency that is rapid in onset and requires immediate medical attention regardless of use of emergency medication on site.     </div>
          <h2>Sprains</h2>
          <p>Sprains, Strains, and Tears: When a sprain, strain, or tear takes place, the first thing to do is immobilize the affected area, elevate it, and apply ice.</p>    
          <h2>Hands Only CPR</h2>
          <p>CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) Arguably the most important first aid skill is CPR. Learning CPR is something many people are somewhat familiar with; it.</p>    
          <h2>Choking</h2>
          <p>Choking happens when an object lodges in the throat or windpipe blocking the flow of air. In adults, a piece of food is usually to blame. Young children often choke on small objects. Choking is life-threatening. It cuts off oxygen to the brain. Give first aid as quickly as possible if you or someone else is choking.</p>    
          <h2>Burns</h2>
          <p>A burn is an injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Burns occur mainly in the home or the workplace.</p>    
          <h2>Cuts and Scrapes</h2>
          <p>Cuts and scrapes are typical injuries that require immediate attention in order to prevent infection. First, wash the wound gently with mild soap and water.</p>    
          <h2>Animal Bite</h2>
          <p>An animal bite is a wound, usually a puncture or laceration, caused by the teeth. An animal bite usually results in a break in the skin but also includes contusions from the excessive pressure on body tissue from the bite. The contusions can occur without a break in the skin. Bites can be provoked or unprovoked.</p>    
          <h2>Insect bites and sting </h2>
          <p>Insect bites usually itch. A sting is when an insect uses another body part, such as a barbed stinger at its tail end, to pierce the skin and inject venom (like a poison). They usually do this in self-defense. Stings are more painful than bites.</p>    
          <h2>Convulsion</h2>
          <p>Convulsions are rapid, involuntary muscle contractions that cause uncontrollable shaking and limb movement.</p>    
          <h2>Fractures</h2>
          <p>A fracture is a break in the continuity of a bone. Fractures range from small partial cracks to complete breaks and can occur in any bone. </p>
